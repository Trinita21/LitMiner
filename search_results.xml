    <Title>Mrs. Miniver</Title>
    <Description>A moving drama about a middle-class English family learning to cope with war, told in a series of dramatic vignettes. The family, headed by the lovely and gracious matriarch, endures the departure of the father for the beaches at Dunkirk, the discovery of a wounded Nazi pilot, the death of the daughter-in-law in an air raid, and the entry of the son into the Royal Air Force.</Description>

    <Title>Growing up</Title>
    <Description>A brilliant comedy of manners, this book does not depend on a plot, but on the people who make up a small village in wartime, whether it is the former great persons, or the stationmaster, the convalescent service personnel, mostly soldiers billetted on a stately home now requisitioned as a hospital, and their anxieties, loves and hopes during World War II. Utterly hilarious, compassionate, and satirical by turns, this book must be one of the best of Thirkell's Barsetshire series.</Description>
